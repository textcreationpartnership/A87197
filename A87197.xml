         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE BLOODY ATTEMPTS Vpon the Kingdom of <hi>IRELAND</hi> in general, and on <hi>DUBLIN</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and how it firſt began.</head>
            <p>UPon the three and twentieth day of October 1641. the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> ſhould have beene ſurpriſed, (as at that time it might eaſily have been) for there was no fear or ſuſpition of Treachery, there being at that time 400. Iriſh Papiſts elected out of moſt parts of Ireland, deſperate perſons, deſigned and appointed for that bloudy and deſperate attempt, all lodging and ſculking in ſeveral places of the City and Suburbs, waiting and expecting the time and watch-word, when to give the onſet. One of their own Country-men at that time, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring ſo foul and deteſtable a Treaſon, revealed it to Sir <hi>William Parſons</hi> Knight and Baronet, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Sir <hi>Iohn Borlaſe</hi> Knight, Maſter of the Ordnance, both Lords Juſtices of the Kingdom of Ireland. The party who diſcovered the plot, had been formerly a ſervant to Sir <hi>Iohn Clotworthy,</hi> but at the time when he revealed their deſigne, he ſerved one Capt. <hi>Mack-Mahowne</hi> an Iriſhman, who lodged at
<pb facs="tcp:169431:16"/> the ſigne of the artichoak, vulgarly called S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Abbey in the ſuburbs of the City of Dublin, The ſervants name was <hi>Owen Mack-Connel,</hi> who being with his maſter Capt. <hi>Mack-Mahown,</hi> in a houſe in Cookſtreet, at the lodging of the Lord <hi>Mack-Gueere,</hi> alſo an Iriſhman in the City of Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. Vpon the two and twentieth of Octob. being the night before: his maſter did then and there reveal the whole plot unto him in the preſence of the Lord <hi>Mack-Gueere,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Owen Mack-Connel</hi> had married an Engliſh woman, by whom he had children living in the County of Antrim, in the Province of Vlſter, and ſhe was and is a Proteſtant; aſſoon as <hi>Owen Mack Connel</hi> had heard and underſtood the plot, and their damnable intentions, with a ſad countenance asked his Maſter what ſhould become of his wife and poor children, he replyed in theſe words: <hi>hang her Engliſh Kite, we will get thee a better Wife:</hi> But the Company perceiving that his thoughts were troubled at the relation of this horrid Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, now to be acted on the ſtage of Ireland, that within few houres was to be in a flame of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the word to be given, that, man, woman, and child ſhould have been butchered the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the poor mans heart failed him at this helliſh and barbarous maſſacre, whereupon theſe bloody Villains, perceiving by the alteration of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that he approved not, or rather, like a man
<pb facs="tcp:169431:16"/> amazed, ſtartled at ſuch a bloody motion, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue his hands of his owne deareſt wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that that is more, of his owne Country and Kingdom, they began to bethink themſelves what to do with him; they reſolved to make him drunk, and thereupon enforced him unnaturally, to drink ſo much that he could hardly drink more, yet they plyed him cloſe, he deſired to be excuſed, they to give him his load powred it downe his throat, he reſiſting ſuch unreaſonable violence, there ſteps towards him one <hi>Donal Mack-Gueere,</hi> ſaying, will you not drink your liquor, ſee if you dare deny to pledge me? thereupon ſet a piſtol to his breſt with two bullets, the pan being primed with powder and brimſtone, that ſo it might not fail to ſpeed, twice it was offered againſt him, and took no fire, whereupon Capt. <hi>Mack-Mahown</hi> ſtept in and ſaid, <hi>let him alone, God will not ſuffer him to be killed, he will be on our ſide I warrant ye.</hi> They after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards led him from the lord <hi>Mack-Gueers</hi> lodging to Capt. <hi>Mack-Mahowns</hi> lodging, but the poor man, faining himſelf more drunk then he was, and taking the advantage of the time and place, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly fell down in a dirty channel, and was ſo bemired with mud, that none would help him up, but with much adoe he crept out of the kennel, and reeled to the ſtoop of a door, and ſate downe to ſleep, he ſeeming to ſleep, the fellow which was left with him to watch with him, departed,
<pb facs="tcp:169431:17"/> which this <hi>Owen Mack-Connel</hi> perceiving, aſſoon as ever his back was turned, with a bold reſolution aroſe up, and went to the Marchants key in Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, between eleven and twelve of the clock at night to Sir <hi>William Parſons</hi> houſe, one of the Lord Juſtices of Ireland, where knocking at the doore, the Porter knowing him, demanded of him what he would have, he anſwered he muſt needs ſpeak with his Lord, the Porter replyed his Lord was in bed, It is no matter anſwered <hi>Owen Mack-Connel,</hi> I muſt and will ſpeak with him, for my buſineſſe concerns both King and Kingdom; then the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter let him in, wondring to ſee him in ſuch a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, ſtill he haſtened the porter, until he had called up one of his Lords Gentlemen, who got up ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and went into his Lords bed-chamber, where he acquainted his Lord with the earneſt deſire this <hi>Owen Mack-Connel</hi> had to ſpeak with him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a buſineſſe of weighty conſequence, but would not reveal it to any but his Honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was called up &amp; had acceſſe to my Lord, unto whom he diſcovered the whole plot, which was to be executed the ſame morning at 9. of the clock, this being between twelve and one.</p>
            <p>At the firſt the Lord <hi>Parſons</hi> did ſeem to ſlight it, but <hi>Owen Mack-Connel</hi> confidently affirmed the thing to be true, and withal told him thus, my lord <hi>I have diſcharged my duty and my conſcience, look you to it; I will go back to my maſter, becauſe neither he, nor the rest ſhall ſuſpect me.</hi>

This <hi>Owen Mack-Connel</hi> going to his maſters lodging, takes dirt in his hands, and beſmuts his face, that they might think he had tumbled over and over in the dirt: whoſe approach into the room (where many were aſſembled together, drinking; for they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to go to bed) was ſo ridiculous, that the company burſt out into ſuch a laughter, the place rung of them round about: and to welcome him home, the company fell to their old courſe, to make him drink more, but he told them that he muſt needs go into the yard, ſo they ſuffered him but commanded two of his companions to attend him, and bring him up again, but they let him go into the yard by himſelf: no ſooner was he in the yard, but he leaped over the pale, and ſo eſcaped.</p>

               <head>A true Deſcription of ſundry ſad and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Collections, taken from the monthes of very credible Perſons, and out of Letters ſent from Ireland to this Citie of London, of the perfidious outrages and barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties which the Irish Papiſts have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the perſons of the Proteſtants, both men, women, and children in that Kingdom, ſince <hi>Anno Dom. 1641.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Iriſh nation is a people both proud and envious. The Commonaltie ignorant and illiterate, poor, and lazie: and will rather beg or ſtarve, then work; and therefore fit ſubject for the Prieſts and Ieſuits to ſpur on upon ſuch bloudy actions and murtherous deſignes.</p>
               <p>It is too well known that the Iriſh have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of the Proteſtant party in the provinces of Vlſter, Leinſter, Connaght, and Munſter, of men women, and children, the number of fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, as it is credibly reported by Engliſhmen, who have been over all parts of the Kingdom, and do proteſt upon their oaths, that there are above five thouſand families deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>The Iriſh have moſt murtherouſly and trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſurpriſed them upon great advantages, and
<pb facs="tcp:169431:19"/> without reſpect of perſons, either of age, youth, or infancie, of young men or maids, or of old men or babes, ſtript all to their skins, naked as ever they were born into the World, ſo they have gone out of the World, many ſtarved to death for want of food and rayment; the Iriſh have ſhewed them no more compaſſion, nor ſo much as they do to their dogs.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Belturbait</hi> in the County of Cavan, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Rebels demanded the Town, on promiſe that if they would ſurrender, they ſhould paſſe free with bag and baggage: On ſerious conſiderations of the inhabitants and the Governour, they were perſwaded to yeeld it up, which when they had done; they ſent about twenty or thirty to guard them; when they had guarded them ſeven miles from the Town, they ſeiſed on them, robbed all the Proteſtants, being between five hundred and a thouſand perſons, men, women, and children: who ſubmitting themſelves to their mercy, found no quarter but cruelty: they ſtript them all naked, and turned them into the open fields in bitter cold weather, not affording them one of their lowzy rags to hide thoſe parts which even nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to be covered.</p>
